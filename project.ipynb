    "## Introduction\n",
    "Deutsch's Algorithm is a fundamental quantum computing algorithm. It serves as one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that performs better than any classical counterpart. This algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem in the quantum computing domain, showcasing the power of quantum superposition and interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "The problem addressed by Deutsch's Algorithm involves a function `f(x)` that takes a binary input (0 or 1) and produces a binary output (0 or 1). There are four possible functions of this type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The constant function that always returns 0.\n",
    "2. The constant function that always returns 1.\n",
    "3. The balanced function that returns 0 for input 0 and 1 for input 1.\n",
    "4. The balanced function that returns 1 for input 0 and 0 for input 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to determine whether the given function `f(x)` is constant (the same output for all inputs) or balanced (different output for each input) by using the function only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deutsch's Algorithm\n",
    "Deutsch's Algorithm provides a quantum solution to this problem. It utilizes the principles of quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference to determine the nature of the function with a single query, which is impossible in the classical computing paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will dive into the details of Deutsch's Algorithm, including its quantum circuit, the mathematics behind it, and how it solves the stated problem.\n"
