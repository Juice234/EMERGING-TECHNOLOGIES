    "The Collatz conjecture, also known as the \"3x + 1 problem,\" is a simple yet unsolved problem in mathematics. It involves a sequence generated by the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with any positive integer \\( x \\).\n",
    "2. If \\( x \\) is even, divide it by 2.\n",
    "3. If \\( x \\) is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n",
    "4. Repeat this process with the new value of \\( x \\).\n",
    "5. The conjecture states that no matter what value you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python function below verifies this conjecture for the first 10,000 positive integers by checking if the sequence generated by each number eventually reaches 1.\n"
