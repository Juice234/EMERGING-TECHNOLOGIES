The x-intercept of this tangent line is a better approximation for the root than x0. We repeat this process, using the x-intercept of each tangent line as the next guess for the root, until we reach a sufficiently accurate approximation."

    "### Implementation of the Square Root Function Using Newton's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This section details the implementation of the `square_root` function, which approximates the square root of a number using Newton's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Error Handling for Negative Numbers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function begins by checking if the input number \\( x \\) is negative. If \\( x \\) is negative, an error message is returned, indicating that the square root of a negative number is not a real number. This is an essential check as square roots of negative numbers fall into the realm of complex numbers, which are not handled in this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Initial Guess for the Square Root:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial guess, \\( z \\), for the square root is set to half of the input value (\\( x/2.0 \\)). This guess serves as a starting point for Newton's iterative method. The choice of \\( x/2.0 \\) as the initial guess is arbitrary but generally provides a good balance between speed and accuracy for convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Iterative Improvement Using Newton's Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function employs a loop to refine the approximation of the square root. The loop continues as long as the absolute difference between \\( z^2 \\) and \\( x \\) is greater than the specified threshold, ensuring that the approximation is sufficiently accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each iteration, the function updates the guess \\( z \\) using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ z = \\frac{(z + \\frac{x}{z})}{2.0} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is derived from the tangent line to the graph of \\( f(y) = y^2 - x \\) at the point \\( (y, f(y)) \\), which intersects the x-axis at \\( (y + \\frac{x}{y}, 0) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Returning the Final Approximation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the difference between \\( z^2 \\) and \\( x \\) falls within the acceptable threshold, the loop concludes, and the function returns the final approximation for the square root, \\( z \\). This value is the function's estimate of the square root of the input number \\( x \\).\n"
